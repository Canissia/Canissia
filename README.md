Pokemon Sprites

This was one of the first projects I made that uses Javascript!
Completed in Cold Steele’s Web Developer Bootcamp. This page displays ALL of the current Pokemon. I added my own twist by using hover to animate each Pokemon.

The goal was to display Pokemon images with Javascript. 

I learned a practical use of ‘For Loop’ by increasing the loop to include all 898 Pokemon. To display each photo with .appendChild and .createElement.
